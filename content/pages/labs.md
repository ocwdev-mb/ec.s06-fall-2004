Course Introduction
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
How to connect the power supply  
  
How to read a voltage, resistance, and current with the DMM  
  
Reading resistors  
  
How protoboard is laid out  
  
Each team builds a voltage divider with nom. 3.3 V output, and measure Vout. However, each team works in different resistance regimes (from 100's of Ohms to 100 kOhm)  
  
Each team puts same set of load resistors on their dividers (100's ohms to MOhm)  
  
All teams exchange data and plot results from all teams on one graph in their notebooks - discuss loading of dividers!

Bridge Circuits
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Build bridge rectifier with LEDs and use the load resister to limit current  
  
See conduction paths light up depending on polarity of AC input  
  
Measure voltage drop across load for both polarities  
  
Measure voltage at each end of load w.r.t. ground of 9V battery for both polarities  
  
Mechanical switch limits speed, so introduce function generator  
  
Find maximum frequency that gives no flicker  
  
Introduce Oscilloscope to view waveforms

Filters
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Each team uses unique RC combination for low-pass filter, measures amplitude response at 10-12 frequency  
  
All teams exchange data and plot results from all teams on one graph in their notebooks - discuss different turn-on voltages  
  
Repeat 3) and 4) for high-pass filters
