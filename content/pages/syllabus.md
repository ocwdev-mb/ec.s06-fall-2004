Horowitz, Paul, and Winfield Hill. _The Art of Electronics_. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989. ISBN: 9780521370950. (Very comprehensive. A reference you can use for many years.)

Mims, Forrest. _Engineer's Notebook_. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1992. ISBN: 9781878707031. (Cookbook circuits for many applications. Little or no explanations.)

Cutcher, Dave. _Electronic Circuits for the Evil Genius_. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2004. ISBN: 9780071448819. (A different approach.)

Crecraft, D., and D. Gorham. _Electronics_. 2nd ed. Gloucestershire: Nelson Thornes, 2003. ISBN: 9780748760077. (Good introduction. Not as in-depth or comprehensive as Horowitz and Hill. A good middle-ground between _Engineer's Notebook_ and Horowitz and Hill.)
